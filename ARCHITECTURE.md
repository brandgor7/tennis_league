# Tennis League Scoring App — Architecture

## Overview

A Django + SQLite web application for managing a tennis league. Multiple seasons coexist, each with independently configurable rules. Admins set up seasons, rosters, and matches. Players log in and enter results. A confirmation flow ensures score accuracy. Dashboards show standings, results, and matchups. A playoff bracket is auto-generated from end-of-season standings.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Backend | Django 5.x (Python) | |
| Database | SQLite (WAL mode) | Used in dev, test, and production |
| Auth | Django `AbstractUser` | Built-in session auth |
| Frontend | Django Templates + Bootstrap 5 | Server-rendered; Bootstrap via CDN |
| Admin | Django admin + custom views | Augmented for league management |
| Config | `django-environ` | `.env` file for secrets |

## Responsive Design

Bootstrap 5's `md` breakpoint (768px) is the single dividing line between **mobile** and **desktop** layouts. No separate stylesheets; all responsiveness is handled with Bootstrap utility classes and the grid.

**Approach per surface:**

### Navigation
- Mobile (`< md`): Bootstrap hamburger navbar (`navbar-expand-md`); links collapse into an off-canvas/dropdown menu; season selector is a full-width item in the menu
- Desktop (`≥ md`): Full horizontal navbar; season selector inline as a dropdown

### Standings Table
- Mobile: Simplified card list — one card per player showing rank, name, W–L, points. Cards are tap-friendly with generous padding.
- Desktop: Table with columns: rank, player, Wins, Losses, Pts, PD (game differential)

### Matchups & Results
- **Matchups** (scheduled/postponed/pending_confirmation):
  - Mobile: cards with player names, scheduled date, status badge; entire card taps to match detail
  - Desktop: table rows with player1, player2, date, status, detail link
- **Results** (completed/walkover): inline tennis scoreboard — no click-through required to see scores
  - Both mobile and desktop show a two-row scoreboard per match: winner name bold/charcoal, loser name muted; each set's game count in fixed-width tabular columns; tiebreak loser score as superscript
  - Walkover matches (no sets) show "W/O" label instead of score columns
  - Mobile: scoreboard card with date + status in a footer strip below
  - Desktop: table with a "Match" column containing the scoreboard; date, status, and "View" link in separate columns

### Match Detail
- Mobile: Stacked layout — match header (players + status), then set scores as a simple horizontal-scrollable score table
- Desktop: Two-column layout — match info on the left, set-by-set score grid on the right

### Result Entry Form
- Mobile: One set per row, full-width number inputs with large tap targets (min 44px height), prominent submit button. Numeric keyboard triggered via `inputmode="numeric"`. Tiebreak fields appear inline below the set row only when needed.
- Desktop: Sets displayed in a grid; all fields visible at once; tab-friendly navigation

### Playoff Bracket
- Mobile: Horizontal-scroll container (`overflow-x: auto`) wrapping the bracket; bracket rendered as a horizontal flow (rounds left to right); player names truncated with full name in tooltip
- Desktop: Full bracket rendered in CSS grid, all rounds visible simultaneously without scrolling

### Player Profile (`/seasons/<id>/players/<player_id>/`)
- Page shows the player's standing (rank, W/L, Pts, PD) for the season, followed by upcoming matches and completed results
- Reuses `_match_list.html` and `_results_list.html` partials
- Mobile: stat summary row, then matches as cards
- Desktop: stat summary row, then matches as a table
- Public — no login required

### Forms (login, walkover, postpone)
- Mobile: Full-width inputs and buttons, stacked labels
- Desktop: Standard form layout with max-width container to prevent over-stretching on wide screens (`max-w: 600px` centered)

## CSS Design System

Source: `static/css/app.css`. All pages extend `base.html`, which loads this file automatically via `{% static %}`. No per-template imports needed.

### Design Tokens

CSS custom properties on `:root`. Use these in any inline styles or future CSS rather than hardcoding values.

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--clay` | `#C4522A` | Primary — buttons, links, active indicators |
| `--clay-dark` | `#A0421E` | Primary hover state |
| `--forest` | `#1B3D2B` | Navbar and footer background |
| `--cream` | `#F7F3EB` | Page background |
| `--sand` | `#EDE5D3` | Secondary surface / alternating rows |
| `--charcoal` | `#1A1A18` | Body text |
| `--muted` | `#6B6558` | Subdued / secondary text |
| `--border` | `#D9CEBE` | Input borders, dividers |
| `--white` | `#FEFCF8` | Card background |

All Bootstrap 5 semantic colour variables (`--bs-primary`, `--bs-body-bg`, etc.) are remapped to these tokens, so standard Bootstrap classes (`btn-primary`, `alert-*`, etc.) use the theme automatically.

### Fonts

- **Headings** (`h1`–`h3`, `.font-serif`): Lora — loaded via `<link>` in `base.html`
- **Body / UI**: DM Sans

### Status Badges

```html
<span class="status-badge status-{value}">Label</span>
```

`{value}` maps directly to `Match.status` field values: `scheduled` (blue), `pending` (amber), `completed` (green), `walkover` (orange), `postponed` (grey-brown), `cancelled` (red).

### Component Classes

| Class | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `.page-header` | Top-of-page wrapper; put `<h1>` and `.page-meta` inside |
| `.page-meta` | Subtitle / metadata line below the page `<h1>` |
| `.rank-number` | Serif rank numeral in standings |
| `.rank-number.rank-top-3` | Rank 1–3 highlighted in clay colour |
| `.stat-value` | Tabular-numeral cell for Wins, Losses, Pts, PD |
| `.score-set` | Large serif score display (e.g. `6–3`) |
| `.score-input` | Compact 64 px centred numeric input for score entry |
| `.match-card` | Card with lift-on-hover; wrapper needs `position: relative` when using `stretched-link` |
| `.text-clay` | Clay-coloured text |
| `.bg-sand` | Sand background fill |
| `.border-theme` | Theme border colour (`--border`) |

### Navigation Active State

Child templates mark a nav link active by emitting `nav-active` from the matching block:

```django
{# e.g. in standings.html: #}
{% block nav_standings %}nav-active{% endblock %}
```

Available blocks: `nav_standings`, `nav_matchups`, `nav_results`, `nav_playoffs`. CSS draws a clay underline on the active link.

### Player Name Links

Every player name rendered in the UI links to that player's profile page (`leagues:player_detail`). This applies to: `_match_list.html`, `_results_list.html`, `_standings_table.html`, `match_detail.html`, and `accounts/profile.html`. The link requires `season.pk` and `player.pk`; season context is always available via `current_season` from the context processor.

### Base Template Context

`base.html` renders the season selector and primary nav links only when these context variables are present:

| Variable | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| `current_season` | `Season` or `None` | Absent → season nav hidden, no error |
| `all_seasons` | QuerySet of `Season` | Populates the season dropdown; filtered by `display` flag for non-staff users (staff see all; enrolled players always see their seasons) |

These are supplied by a context processor added in **Phase 4**. Until then, season nav is simply hidden.

## Django Apps

### `accounts`
- Custom `User` model extending `AbstractUser`
- Login / logout views
- Player profile view (their matches, record)

### `leagues`
- `Season` model — all per-season configuration
- `SeasonPlayer` model — roster (which users are in which season)
- `SiteConfig` model — singleton; stores `site_name` and `logo_svg` (sanitized SVG text); configurable in admin
- Season list, detail views
- `SeasonPlayerDetailView` — public player profile page showing standing, upcoming matches, and results for a player within a season
- Admin: create/edit seasons, manage rosters, edit site name and logo

### `matches`
- `Match` model — scheduling, status, players, result
- `MatchSet` model — individual set scores (supports tiebreak scores)
- `scheduler.py` — `generate_schedule(season, start_date, num_rounds)`: round-robin schedule generation across all tiers; idempotent across calls — already-scheduled matchup pairs are filtered out so no pair is ever duplicated within a season, enabling batch scheduling (e.g. schedule first 3 rounds, then 3 more later). `remaining_rounds_count(season, tier)` returns how many rounds remain schedulable for a tier.
- Result entry view (for a player in the match)
- Result confirmation view (for the opponent)
- Walkover and postponement views (admin or player)

### `standings`
- No models — standings are computed dynamically from `Match` + `MatchSet` data
- `calculator.py` — pure function that takes a Season and returns ranked player list
- Standings view renders the table

### `playoffs`
- `PlayoffBracket` model — one per season, records when generated
- `PlayoffSlot` model — one per bracket position; links to a `Match`; has `next_slot` FK for winner advancement
- Generator: reads standings, seeds bracket, creates `Match` + `PlayoffSlot` objects
- Bracket view renders the visual bracket

## Data Models

### `leagues.SiteConfig`
```
site_name   CharField(100)   Navbar brand name and page footer; default "TennisLeague"
logo        TextField        Base64 data URL (data:image/png;base64,… or data:image/jpeg;base64,…); blank = default icon shown
pk          always 1         Singleton — enforced by model.save() and admin
```
Logo uploads are validated in the admin form: magic bytes are checked (PNG `\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n`, JPEG `\xff\xd8\xff`) to confirm the file type regardless of extension, and size is capped at 2 MB. The data URL is stored in the database — no file system writes, no MEDIA configuration needed.

## Standings Calculation

Computed dynamically in `standings/calculator.py`. No cache table needed at typical league scale.

Standings are **per-tier**: the calculator takes a season and tier number, returning the ranked player list for that tier only. The standings view iterates over all tiers in the season and renders a separate table (or tab) for each.

**Algorithm (for a given season + tier):**
```
For each active SeasonPlayer in season where tier == requested_tier:
  matches = Match.objects.filter(
      season=season,
      tier=requested_tier,
      status__in=['completed', 'walkover'],
      player in [player1, player2]
  )
  wins   = matches where winner == player
  losses = matches - wins (not counting walkovers where player isn't winner)

  points = (wins * season.points_for_win)
         + (walkover_losses * season.points_for_walkover_loss)
         + (regular_losses * season.points_for_loss)

  games_won, games_lost = sum from MatchSet (walkovers contribute 0)
  pd = games_won - games_lost

Returned dict per player: player, wins, losses, points, pd

Ranking tiebreakers (applied internally, not exposed in the returned dict):
  1. points (desc)
  2. matches_played (desc — more matches played ranks higher)
  3. sets_won / sets_played ratio (desc)
  4. games_won / games_played ratio (desc)
  5. head-to-head result (if still equal — not yet implemented)
```

`calculate_standings(season, tier)` → ranked list for one tier.
The standings view calls this for each tier in `range(1, season.num_tiers + 1)`.

## Match Result Flow

```
[scheduled]
     │
     ▼  Player enters score
[pending_confirmation]
     │
     ├──▶ Opponent confirms ──▶ [completed]
     │
     └──▶ Opponent disputes ──▶ Admin reviews ──▶ [completed] or stays pending

Admin can also directly:
     [scheduled] ──▶ [walkover]
     [scheduled] ──▶ [postponed]
     [postponed] ──▶ [scheduled]  (with new date)
     any state   ──▶ [cancelled]
```

**Authorization rules:**
- Only `player1` or `player2` of the match can enter results (or admin/staff)
- Only the *other* player from whoever entered can confirm (or admin/staff)
- Walkover and postponement: admin/staff only, or either player (configurable)

---

## Playoff Bracket Generation

In `playoffs/generator.py`:

Brackets are generated **per tier**. `generate_bracket(season, tier, generated_by)` handles one tier at a time. The admin action can call it for each tier in the season.

1. Read standings for `(season, tier)` → top `season.playoff_qualifiers_count` players in that tier
2. Determine bracket size (next power of 2 ≥ qualifier count)
3. Standard tennis bracket seeding for 16-draw:
   - Position 1: seed 1 vs seed 16
   - Position 2: seed 8 vs seed 9
   - Position 3: seed 5 vs seed 12
   - Position 4: seed 4 vs seed 13
   - Position 5: seed 3 vs seed 14
   - Position 6: seed 6 vs seed 11
   - Position 7: seed 7 vs seed 10
   - Position 8: seed 2 vs seed 15
4. Create `Match` objects (round=`r16` or appropriate, status=`scheduled`, tier=tier)
5. Create `PlayoffBracket` (with `tier` field) + `PlayoffSlot` objects with correct `next_slot` links
6. When a playoff match completes: a post-save signal (or explicit view logic)
   sets the winner as `player1` or `player2` in the next round's `Match`

## Forms

| Form | Fields |
|------|--------|
| `ResultEntryForm` | Dynamic: N sets × (p1_games, p2_games, tb_p1, tb_p2). Validates legal scores. |
| `WalkoverForm` | winner (player1/player2/none), reason |
| `PostponeForm` | new_scheduled_date, reason |
| `SeasonForm` | All Season config fields, including `num_tiers` |
| `MatchScheduleForm` | player1, player2, scheduled_date — player dropdowns filtered to same tier |

### Admin: Analyze / Generate Schedule

Custom admin view at `/admin/seasons/<id>/generate-schedule/`. Combines schedule generation, analysis, and manual match management on one page:

- **Tier overview table** — active players, total rounds, remaining rounds per tier
- **Add Rounds form** — start date + number of rounds; hidden when all rounds are exhausted
- **Schedule Analysis** (shown once any matches exist):
  - *Matches by Date* — match count per date per tier; totals row and grand total
  - *Players with Fewer Scheduled Matches* — per-tier cards showing players whose scheduled match count is below the tier maximum, with deficit badge; replaced by a green confirmation when all players are equal
- **Schedule a Match** — tier dropdown → player list (sorted by fewest matches) → opponent columns (new matchup / already played) → optional date → creates a single `Match` record
- **Delete a Match** — tier dropdown → scheduled-matches dropdown (ordered by date, then player name) → inline confirmation → deletes the match

Analysis data is computed by `SeasonAdmin._build_schedule_analysis(season, tier_range)` which returns `None` when no matches exist. Per-player match counts are computed by `SeasonAdmin._match_count_map(season, tier, tier_players)`, shared across the analysis and the two manual-scheduling endpoints.

A **Bulk Add Results** button on the season change page opens a two-step flow:

1. **Parse step** — admin pastes raw WhatsApp-style messages into a textarea and submits. `matches/bulk_result_parser.py` parses each line to extract winner, loser, and score. The parser handles WhatsApp message headers (sender name or phone number), `@⁨~Name⁩` mention tags, tier prefixes (`T1`, `Tier 2`, etc.), and verb variants (`d`, `d.`, `def`, `defeated`, `beat`, `over`, `wins`, `won`). Scores can be `N-M` or `N:M`. If the opponent is referred to as "me", the poster name is used to identify them; if the poster is unknown (phone-only), the resolver infers the opponent from the player's next scheduled match.
2. **Review step** — parsed results are matched against the season's scheduled/postponed matches and active players using fuzzy name scoring. The admin sees a table of original messages alongside the guessed match, winner, score, and confidence. Rows with a match found have a pre-checked confirm checkbox; rows with errors show the reason. Submitting saves only the checked rows: creates a single `MatchSet`, marks the match completed, and auto-confirms it (admin privilege).

Five supporting JSON/POST endpoints on `SeasonAdmin`:

| URL | Method | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `/admin/seasons/<id>/schedule-match/players/?tier=<n>` | GET | Players in tier with match counts |
